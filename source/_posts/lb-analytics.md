the past few months, i've been building load balancing analytics at cloudflare. it was a fun project that helped me learn clickhouse, cap'n proto, kafka, and graphql. i wrote my first blog post for the company as part of the launch - [link here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-load-balancing-analytics/).
