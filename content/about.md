title: "About Me"
---

My name is Rohin. I'm a Systems Engineer at Cloudflare working on all things IP Addresses. Previously, I attended [Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu), where I majored in Math & Computer Science. I enjoy tech, sustainability, basketball, and the outdoors.

This blog will be a collection of topics I find interesting - technical and non-technical. Send me a note over email at [alohe@hmc.edu](alohe@hmc.edu).
